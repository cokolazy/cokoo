    <br>The official 'Bohemian Rhapsody' music video. Taken from Queen - 'Greatest Video Hits 1'. Lyrics below: <br>
    <br>
        Is this the real life? <br>
        Is this just fantasy? <br>
        Caught in a landslide <br>
        No escape from reality <br>
        Open your eyes <br>
        Look up  to the skies and see <br>
        I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy <br>
        Because I'm easy come, easy go <br>
        A little high, little low <br>
        Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me <br>
    <br>
        Mama, just killed a man <br>
        Put a gun against his head <br>
        Pulled my trigger, now he's dead <br>
        Mama, life had just begun <br>
        But now I've gone and thrown it all away <br>
        Mama, ooo <br>
        Didn't mean to make you cry <br>
        If I'm not back again this time tomorrow <br>
        Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters <br>
    <br>
        Too late, my time has come <br>
        Sends shivers down my spine <br>
        Body's aching all the time <br>
        Goodbye everybody - I've got to go <br>
        Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth <br>
        Mama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows) <br>
        I don't want to die <br>
        I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all <br>
    <br>
        I see a little silhouetto of a man <br>
        Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango <br>
        Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me <br>
        Gallileo, Gallileo, <br>
        Gallileo, Gallileo, <br>
        Gallileo Figaro - magnifico <br>
    <br>
        But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me <br>
        He's just a poor boy from a poor family <br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
        Spare him his life from this monstrosity <br>
        Easy come easy go - will you let me go <br>
        Bismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go <br>
        Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go <br>
        Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go <br>
        Will not let you go - let me go (never) <br>
        Never let you go - let me go <br>
        Never let me go - ooo <br>
        No, no, no, no, no, no, no - <br>
        Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go <br>
        Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me <br>
        for me <br>
        for me <br>
    <br>
        So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye <br>
        So you think you can love me and leave me to die <br>
        Oh baby - can't do this to me baby <br>
        Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here <br>
    <br>
        Ooh yeah, ooh yeah <br>
        Nothing really matters <br>
        Anyone can see <br>
        Nothing really matters - nothing really matters to me <br>
    <br>
        Anyway the wind blows... <br>
    <br>
        Anyway the wind blows... <br>
